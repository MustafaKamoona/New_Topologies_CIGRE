# Plotting:
## Data and Figures (file)
Fine name (New plot): post-processing and plotting notebooks

### Run files:
For Currents: Current Box Plotting Topologies_V2.ipynb
For Voltages: Voltage Box Plotting Topologies_V2.ipynb

# Notes
1- Bus voltages and feeder currents are saved in each run notebook for post-processing.
2- Builder notebooks must be executed before running any topology.
3- Load cases: Case 1 → Load-1 AND Case 3 → Load-2
